## General Information
Tofu is a virtual pet game built in Python using Pygame. Players take care of their pet turtle, Tofu, by keeping it happy, clean, and energized. The game simulates real pet-care interactions, allowing users to feed, play, and rest their turtle, and watch it grow from a baby to an adult.

You can use this project to learn about game development in Python, state management, and UI/UX design, or simply have fun bonding with your virtual turtle.

## Features
- Multiple life stages — baby, teen, and adult Tofu
- Animated emotions and actions (energetic, clean, sleeping, etc.)
- Real-time happiness, hunger, and cleanliness tracking
- Win or lose based on how well you care for Tofu
- Smooth transitions, aesthetic fonts, and background music
- Achievement and progress system for incentive
- End screen with growth summary and stats
